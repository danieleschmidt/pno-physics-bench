## üéØ PRODUCTION READINESS ASSESSMENT

üîß **NEEDS MINOR IMPROVEMENTS**
The robustness framework is largely complete but requires some enhancements
before full production deployment.


## üèóÔ∏è ARCHITECTURE OVERVIEW

The Generation 2 robustness implementation follows a multi-layered approach:

1. **Application Layer:** Robust model wrappers with comprehensive error handling
2. **Security Layer:** Input validation, threat detection, and access control  
3. **Monitoring Layer:** Real-time metrics, health checks, and distributed tracing
4. **Infrastructure Layer:** Resource management, graceful shutdown, and configuration
5. **Quality Gates:** Automated validation pipeline with rollback capabilities
