# Project Charter: pno-physics-bench

## Project Overview

**Project Name**: pno-physics-bench  
**Project Owner**: Daniel Schmidt (Terragon Labs)  
**Project Type**: Open Source Research Platform  
**Start Date**: January 2025  
**Expected Duration**: 24 months to v1.0  

## Problem Statement

Current neural PDE solvers provide impressive accuracy but lack uncertainty quantification capabilities essential for safety-critical applications. Existing uncertainty methods are either:
- Computationally prohibitive (deep ensembles)
- Theoretically questionable (MC dropout)
- Not designed for neural operators (classical UQ methods)

This gap prevents adoption of neural PDE solvers in high-stakes engineering and scientific applications where uncertainty quantification is mandatory.

## Project Mission

Develop the first comprehensive benchmark suite for Probabilistic Neural Operators (PNOs) that provides rigorous uncertainty quantification for neural PDE solvers, establishing new standards for trustworthy AI in computational science.

## Success Criteria

### Primary Success Criteria
1. **Technical Excellence**: Achieve 90%+ uncertainty calibration across all benchmark PDEs
2. **Performance**: Maintain <2x computational overhead compared to deterministic methods
3. **Reproducibility**: 100% reproducible results with comprehensive testing
4. **Adoption**: 1000+ monthly active users within 18 months

### Secondary Success Criteria
1. **Research Impact**: 50+ citations in peer-reviewed papers
2. **Industry Adoption**: 10+ companies using in production environments
3. **Community Growth**: 100+ external contributors
4. **Educational Impact**: Adopted by 20+ university courses
