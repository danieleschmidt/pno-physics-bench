# ADR-0001: Use Probabilistic Neural Operators for Uncertainty Quantification

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Traditional neural operators like Fourier Neural Operators (FNO) and Transformer Neural Operators (TNO) provide deterministic predictions for PDE solutions but lack uncertainty quantification capabilities. For safety-critical applications in engineering and scientific computing, uncertainty estimates are crucial for:

- Reliability assessment of predictions
- Active learning and adaptive sampling
- Risk-aware decision making
- Model validation and verification

## Decision

We will implement Probabilistic Neural Operators (PNOs) as the primary architecture for uncertainty quantification in neural PDE solvers, incorporating:

1. **Variational Parameters**: Replace deterministic weights with distributions
2. **Bayesian Inference**: Use variational inference for approximate posterior learning
3. **Uncertainty Decomposition**: Separate aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty
4. **Calibration Metrics**: Implement proper scoring rules and calibration measures

## Consequences

### Positive

- Rigorous uncertainty quantification for PDE solutions
- Better model interpretability and trustworthiness
- Support for active learning workflows
- Improved model validation capabilities
- Novel research contributions to the field

### Negative

- Increased computational overhead (1.5-2x training time)
- Additional hyperparameter tuning (KL weights, sampling strategies)
- More complex implementation and debugging
- Higher memory requirements during training

### Neutral

- Compatible with existing neural operator architectures
- Can be applied to various PDE types

## Alternatives Considered

1. **Ensemble Methods**: Simple but computationally expensive, limited uncertainty types
2. **Monte Carlo Dropout**: Easy to implement but theoretically questionable
3. **Deep Ensembles**: Good performance but 5-10x computational cost
4. **Gaussian Processes**: Principled uncertainty but doesn't scale to high dimensions

## Implementation Notes

- Start with spectral convolution layers with variational parameters
- Implement ELBO loss with KL regularization
- Use reparameterization trick for gradient estimation
- Target 80%+ test coverage for uncertainty quantification modules
- Benchmark against deterministic baselines on standard PDE datasets
