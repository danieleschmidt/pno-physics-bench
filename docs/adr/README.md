# Architecture Decision Records (ADR)

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for the pno-physics-bench project.

## What is an ADR?

An Architecture Decision Record (ADR) is a document that captures an important architectural decision made along with its context and consequences.

## ADR Template

Use the template in `0000-template.md` for new ADRs.

## Status

- **Proposed**: The decision is being considered but not yet adopted
- **Accepted**: The decision has been accepted and is being implemented
- **Superseded**: The decision has been replaced by a newer decision
- **Deprecated**: The decision is no longer relevant

## Naming Convention

ADRs should be numbered sequentially and use the format:
```
NNNN-title-with-dashes.md
```
