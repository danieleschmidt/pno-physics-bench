# ADR-0003: Variational Inference for Approximate Bayesian Learning

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Probabilistic Neural Operators require Bayesian inference over network parameters to quantify epistemic uncertainty. Exact Bayesian inference is intractable for neural networks, requiring approximate methods. Key requirements:

- Scalable to large parameter spaces (millions of parameters)
- Differentiable for gradient-based optimization
- Computationally efficient for practical use
- Theoretically grounded uncertainty estimates

## Decision

We will use Variational Inference (VI) with mean-field Gaussian approximation as the primary approach for approximate Bayesian learning in PNOs:

1. **Mean-field assumption**: Independent Gaussian distributions for each parameter
2. **Reparameterization trick**: For gradient estimation through sampling
3. **ELBO optimization**: Maximize Evidence Lower BOund as surrogate objective
4. **KL scheduling**: Adaptive weighting of KL divergence term

## Consequences

### Positive

- Scalable to large neural networks
- Single forward pass produces uncertainty estimates
- Theoretically principled framework
- Compatible with standard optimization methods
- Enables uncertainty decomposition (aleatoric vs epistemic)

### Negative

- Mean-field assumption may underestimate parameter correlations
- Requires tuning of KL weight hyperparameter
- Additional computational overhead (~50% compared to deterministic)
- Potential for posterior collapse in early training

### Neutral

- Well-established method in Bayesian deep learning
- Good baseline for comparison with other approaches

## Alternatives Considered

1. **MCMC Methods**: More accurate but computationally prohibitive
2. **Laplace Approximation**: Simpler but requires Hessian computation
3. **Normalizing Flows**: More flexible but significantly more complex
4. **Ensemble Methods**: Non-Bayesian but proven effective

## Implementation Notes

- Start with KL weight Î²=1e-4 and adapt during training
- Use local reparameterization trick for convolutional layers
- Implement KL annealing from 0 to target value over epochs
- Monitor ELBO components separately for debugging
- Validate against MC-Dropout baseline
